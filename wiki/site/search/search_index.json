Peace is a fragile thing in Phame Games\u2019\u00a9 Minecraft\u00ae Eric's Mine Mod Madness\u2122! Object of the Game Be the team to control the most money (represented by gold, silver, and bronze coins) at the end of the play period (4 weeks). Money is obtained through working , trading , and raiding. Rules There are a few simple, but very important rules to keep the game enjoyable for the creators and \u2013 uh, de-creators of the game alike. Definitions Term Definition Base An above ground area surrounded by colored banners with a tower in the center that has banners on each side. A base includes all airspace and 6 blocks below the surface. Raid An attack by one team on a single base of another team. War A mutual attack between all bases of two teams. Raid Chest A chest at the bottom of the base\u2019s tower that holds money that can be stolen during a raid or war. Amount depends on the base\u2019s size. Loot To steal from a chest or shop (other than the raid chest during a raid/war) Grief To destroy buildings or structures (besides small, infiltration damage during a raid/war) Main Rules No griefing or looting within the boundaries of someone else\u2019s base, ever. No stealing from the raid chest or attacking players in their base, unless that base is being raided or that team is at war with your team. Griefing, looting, and attacking are all permissible at any time outside of established bases. You may always attack other players in your base. No players of ANY team may enter a base if less than half its owners are online (i.e. no hiding in bases that cannot be raided) Base Rules Anyone can build a base by placing their team\u2019s banners at ground level around an area. There must be 2 banners facing outward at each corner and 1 banner every 10 blocks. The base borders must be rectangular. The base must have a tower at least 8 blocks high near the center of the base with a banner on each side of the tower, all visible outside of the base. The base must have a raid chest, with a sign above it reading Raid Chest , at the bottom of the base\u2019s center tower that is theoretically reachable without destroying any blocks. Once built, the base must be registered under your team color by verbally informing the moderator of your team color. The moderator will give you a base number and you can then fill out the required base sign: Base 6 Owners: Regulator, Phabbits Raid Rules At least half of the base\u2019s owners must be online to start a raid at that base. Anyone can declare a raid on another team\u2019s base as long as there is no raid timer present for that base (including pre- and post-raid), and that team is not involved in a war. To declare a raid, first select which base (in this case base 5) by typing: /trigger raid-base set 5 Then activate the raid against the team owning the base (in this case team blue): /trigger raid-blue Once the raid is declared, the defending team will be warned and the purple pre-raid timer is started. Only the defending team is allowed in the base during the pre-raid. The raid is marked by a red timer. The attackers will try to reach and empty the raid chest. This is the only time the raid chest can be looted. After the raid, successful or not, a white post-raid timer will commence. The base cannot be raided again during this time and the defenders have this long to refill the raid chest. War Rules At least half of each team\u2019s players must be online to start a war. To declare a war (in this case against team blue), type: /trigger war-blue Wars are the same as raids, except every base of both teams are being raided at once. Only the two teams at war can freely empty raid chests. The post-war timer prevents both wars and raids for a set time against that team. Capture Rules If a base has no raid or war timer running, its raid chest must be adequately filled. If it is not, any player at that base can inform the moderator to change the base to the neutral color, eliminating the base\u2019s grief and loot protections. A neutral base can be captured by being first to fill its raid chest adequately and informing the moderator. Getting started It's important to know about the JobsAddon mod before starting so you do not miss out on money and experience at the beginning of the game. This mod adds two important features: working and trading. Working The JobsAddon mod rewards the player for performing simple \"jobs\" like cutting down trees or farming. It is important you select a job by going to your inventory and clicking on the jobs tab at the top of the inventory. Here you can select a task you would like to be rewarded for. Lumberjack, Builder, and Warrior are all good starting jobs. When you level up your job, you will get experience points towards skills (described in LevelZ ) and money. You can change your job every 20 minutes, but specializing in one job will give you the best rewards. Trading The Numismatic Overhaul mod allows players to place trading tables and set up villager-like trades. This means players can deposit some item (say a diamond) and request some amount of money (say a silver coin) for said item. The seller would fill the trading table with as many items as they'd like to sell and collect money from it after someone has purchased the items. Trading is important since the LevelZ mod forces players to specialize in a skill to obtain high-level items.
