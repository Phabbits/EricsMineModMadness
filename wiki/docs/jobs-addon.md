# Jobs Addon

## Job tasks
A player earns experience and gets paid by completing tasks related to that job. For example, a lumberjack levels up by harvesting wood blocks.

When selecting a job, **only click once**. Select the job again to become unemployed, then you can select another job. There is a twenty minute cooldown between switching jobs.

See the table below for each job.
