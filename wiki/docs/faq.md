## Why can't I gather stone or use a furnace?
You need to have skills to do basic actions. This was added by the LevelZ mod and helps encourage cooperation among teammates and other bases. Read about the LevelZ mod [here](https://phame.dev/emmm/levelz/)

## Why are my high level weapons doing so little damage?
You need skills (combat specifically) to get the full effect of high level weapons. You can still use these weapons but they will deal almost no damage. The same happens for certain tools that you aren't skilled enough to use. This is an effect of the LevelZ mod. You can see what level and what skills you need to do stuff [here](https://phame.dev/emmm/levelz/)
